National Rail Open Data Java Example
====================================

This repository contains two Java 8 examples of how to use the Darwin v16 messages
from the National Rail Open Data platform, located at the following URL:

* https://opendata.nationalrail.co.uk/

To use this service, you will need to sign up for a free account and subscribe
to the 'Darwin' feed.

Configuration
-------------

Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties`, uncomment and set the username,
password and hostname keys to the values shown on the 'My Feeds' page.

To customise the JMS Client ID sent to the ActiveMQ server, change the definition
of `this.clientId` in the constructor method for `DarwinClientRouteBuilder`. You
do not need to change this unless you will have more than one client subscribing
to the topic.

Generating classes
------------------

The messages are produced in XML format, and a good way to consume them is by
using generated classes with [JAXB](https://github.com/mojohaus/jaxb2-maven-plugin). 

Using Maven, run the following command:

`mvn jaxb2:xjc`

This will generate classes in `target/classes`.  You may need to mark the
`generated-sources` directory in your IDE as a generated sources root.

Running the code
----------------

The code has been written on Java 8 with [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
Other versions of Java have not been tested.

Running the `DarwinClient` class will show the raw message body and print the
timestamp from the parse XML through the classes generated by JAXB.
